# Introduction to TensorFlow

Date: 2023-09-31

TensorFlow is an open-source machine learning framework developed by Google. It provides a flexible ecosystem of tools and libraries for building and deploying machine learning models.

### Key Features of TensorFlow
- **Scalability**: Run models on CPUs, GPUs, or TPUs.
- **Ease of Use**: High-level APIs like Keras simplify model building.
- **Production-Ready**: Tools like TensorFlow Lite and TensorFlow Serving enable deployment across platforms.

### Applications of TensorFlow
- **Image Recognition**: Build convolutional neural networks (CNNs).
- **Natural Language Processing**: Develop transformers and RNNs.
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Train agents for decision-making tasks.

TensorFlow is a powerful tool for exploring the potential of machine learning.
