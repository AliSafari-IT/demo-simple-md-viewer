# Authentication

Date: 2024-07-31


Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user or system. It plays a pivotal role in ensuring secure access to applications and services.

### Types of Authentication
1. **Password-Based Authentication**: Traditional but prone to breaches.
2. **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Combines multiple verification methods for added security.
3. **OAuth**: A token-based framework for authorization.
4. **Biometric Authentication**: Uses fingerprints, facial recognition, or voice to verify identity.

### Best Practices for Secure Authentication
- Use strong, unique passwords or passphrases.
- Implement MFA for critical systems.
- Regularly update and audit authentication protocols.

Secure authentication is the cornerstone of modern cybersecurity, protecting both users and systems from unauthorized access.
