# Unit Testing

Date: 2023-09-31

## Description
Unit testing is a critical practice in software development where individual components or functions are tested in isolation. It ensures that each unit of code performs as expected, reducing the risk of bugs in production.

### Why Unit Testing Matters
- **Early Bug Detection**: Catch issues early in the development cycle.
- **Refactoring Confidence**: Modify code without fear of breaking functionality.
- **Documentation**: Serve as living documentation for code behavior.

### Popular Unit Testing Frameworks
- **JUnit**: For testing Java applications.
- **xUnit**: A versatile framework for .NET.
- **Jest**: Popular for JavaScript and React applications.
- **PyTest**: Ideal for Python projects.

A robust unit testing strategy is essential for building high-quality software and maintaining long-term stability.
